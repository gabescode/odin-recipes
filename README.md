This is my first odin project! Hopefully by the end of this project I will be
able to create a fully functioning html skeleton to show off on github and I will
be trying to get nice and comfy with the git / Linux command line to push, commit,
and pull requests. This is also a recipe project not sure what it entails but I hope
to come out a little more confident in html.
