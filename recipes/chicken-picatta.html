      <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These quick and easy pan-fried chicken breasts are topped with a simple pan sauce made with capers, butter, white wine, and lemon juice.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>cayenne pepper, or to taste </li>
        <li> salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>all-purpose flour for dredging </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained </li>
        <li>½ cup white wine </li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice </li>
        <li>¼ cup water </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh Italian parsley, chopped </li>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
      </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
          <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
          <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
          <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed though, about 30 seconds.</li>
          <li>Pour white wine into skillet. Scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
          <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
        </ol>
